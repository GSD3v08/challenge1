## My process

### Built with

- VS Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this challenge i started using flexbox , i was using float before but using flexbox to organize the elements inside a box was easier than using float.
I tried to organize the properties by sections(positioning, box-model..) , I hope it is ok.
this is my first challenge, but i think that i learned a little more how to use flexbox.


### Continued development

Learn more about how to structure the content with html.
Built more projects with Flexbox.
Learn more about background property.
to get used to working with git.
